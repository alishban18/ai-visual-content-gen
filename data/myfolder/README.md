The Unsplash Dataset is made up of over 350,000+ contributing global photographers and data sourced from hundreds of millions of searches across a nearly unlimited number of uses and contexts.
Due to the breadth of intent and semantics contained within the Unsplash dataset, it enables new opportunities for research and learning.
